A couple things
Some have greatness thrust upon them
It's eggs
Don't be so literal
So often I pleasure myself
Who doesn't love alliteration
Rhyme is not an easy thingly
That's right we're fancy
That little turd
Don't be a penis
Don't hate
I'm not in a pickle
Eat your cabbage
What the hell are musicals?
I believe it's pronounced "Mis√©rables"
It's a musical
What's that coming up the Silk Road
What's that creeping round your peepee
Black Death, woo!
Oozing like syrup
Alone in my bedroom
I get all tingly
I could scream
We want Will
The man who put the "I am" in Iambic Pentameter
Shall I compare thee
Will Power
I am the Will (He is the Will)
Parting is such sweet sorrow
No more 'Mr. Anonymous'
I'm the cats meow
I'm gonna sizzle
My accomplishments are much more accomplished than yours
Welcome to the Renaissance
It's so incredibly hard
Sexy but it's hard
So good for eating
Do it with love
What do you mean there's no omelette?
I think you're out of your mind
Everyone loves breakfast
On our way to glory
Alas poor yolk
You can smell it
It's all gone to pot
Cheese and vegetables
Shipoopi, Chicago
Take that egg and beat it
To thine own self be true
I see it now
Hamlet! I was this close
The chorus boys are kinda gay
